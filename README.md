## 💻 Code Structure

Our Hangman implementation now uses a robust class-based architecture that improves organization, maintainability, and extensibility:

```
HangmanGame
├── __init__()              # Initialize game variables and resources
├── loading_screen()        # Display introductory visuals
├── display_game_rules()    # Show instructions and options
├── select_difficulty()     # Choose game mode
├── select_word_category()  # Select custom word category
├── play_game()             # Main game loop
├── display_game_state()    # Render UI and game elements
├── check_game_status()     # Evaluate win/loss conditions
├── update_hidden_word()    # Process letter revelations
├── get_hint()              # Provide player assistance
├── display_leaderboard()   # Show and filter high scores
└── save_score_pickle()     # Persist player achievements
```

### Key Improvements

- **Encapsulation**: Game state is properly contained within the class
- **Reduced Global Variables**: Improved data management via instance attributes
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust handling of edge cases
- **Better Code Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality
